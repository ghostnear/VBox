# VBox 0.1.2

This project aims to have emulators for different platforms written in such a way that they can be easily understood.

It is currently a WIP as only a CHIP8 interpreter is available.

Bugs should be expected, help is always welcome.

## How to build and run

The easiest way to build the app is by running the *build.vsh* file from the *scripts* folder.

Then you can run the executable from the *build* folder or use the alternative *run.vsh* file from the *scripts* folder to run it.

Keep in mind that the *run.vsh* script uses the following format:

**run.vsh <emulator_type> <emulated_file_path>**.

If your path has spaces in it, surround it with quotes ("") to avoid any issues.
