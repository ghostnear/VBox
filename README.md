# VBox 1.0.0

This project aims to have emulators for different platforms written in such a way that they can be easily understood.

It is currently a WIP as only a CHIP8 interpreter is available.

Bugs should be expected, help is always welcome.

Also beware as I am preparing this for the actual 1.0.0, stuff is gonna be unfinished.

## Platform information

### [CHIP8](./docs/CHIP8.md)

## Targets

### 1.0.0

- CHIP8 emulator working.
- (OPTIONAL) CHIP8 extensions.
