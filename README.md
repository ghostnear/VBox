# VBox 0.1.0

This project aims to have emulators for different platforms written in such a way that they can be easily understood.

It is currently a WIP as only a CHIP8 interpreter is available. It currently is forced to run any ROM that is present at the path: 'roms/chip8/games/Pong (1 player).ch8'.

You can change that and the display mode from main.v. (The terminal display mode does not support input for now)

Bugs should be expected, help is always welcome.
